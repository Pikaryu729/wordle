uv pip install -e .
```

Thats it! you're ready to run the solver

## ðŸ§© Usage

Run the solver

```bash
python3 main.py
Guess Number 1
Starting Guess: tares
Enter list of numbers: 0 - grey, 1 - yellow, 2 - green:
```

enter the starting guess "tares" into the wordle program, and enter your result.
for example if you get this:
![Example wordle](/images/example-wordle.png)

You would enter like this:

```bash

Enter list of numbers: 0 - grey, 1 - yellow, 2 - green: 02001
Guess number 2
Best Guess: salsa
```

Repeat until it finds the answer.

## ðŸ“š How it works:

1. The solver finds the word with the most entropy in it's current word list
2. Solver updates word list by removing all impossible words
3. Repeat
